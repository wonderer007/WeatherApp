WAVES AND SURF...Northwest swells 12 to 14 feet at 17 to 18 second periods. Breakers of 16 to 22 feet possible. * TIMING...Thursday night through early Saturday morning. * HIGH TIDE...High tide will correspond with the peak of the swell Friday morning between 10 am and 12 noon. Localized coastal flooding possible as a result of increased wave run-up. * IMPACTS...Large breaking waves along the coast will lead to increased wave run-up on beaches with waves topping and washing over large rocks and jetties. Use extra caution near the surf zone as these large waves will be capable of sweeping people into the frigid and turbulent ocean water. Cold water shock may cause cardiac arrest, and it also can cause an involuntary gasp reflex causing drowning, even for a good swimmer. Long periods increases the risk of rip currents. The surf zone will be dangerous due to strong currents and powerful breaking waves.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=CA125D22065FE0.HighSurfAdvisory.125D22250530CA.MTRCFWMTR.31073776620759cabc8fff4c1c0777c7"}],"flags":{"sources":["nwspa","cmc","gfs","hrrr","icon","isd","madis","nam","sref","darksky","nearest-precip"],"nearest-station":2.24,"units":"us"},"offset":-8}'
